                <li><a href="https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1223293/img_4328.jpg?auto=compress&w=900&h=675&fit=min&fm=jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Custom Made RC Car</b></a>
                    <!--I couldn't find the precise image of the actual RC car kit that we used in my class, but it was a kit that had a lot of ocumentation and came with a hefty book teaching you about the basics of electricity, electronic components, how they work, and how to use and recogize them,as well as delving into IC chips and general purpouse soldering. We built both the car and the handle that controled it's movements (like what is in the photo). 
                    TL:DR, the car in the photo is not the one I actually built, it just looks close to it.-->
                    <p>This was a project made during the fall trimester of my junior year in highschool. Through this project, I learned about electronic basics, including the Ohm's triangle, introductory circuits, reading resistors, reading IC schematics to facilitate proper useage, and soldering electronics onto a PCB, and assembling a RC car from parts to functional car, as well as soldering separate electronics onto a separate PCB to allow 2-way communications from a remote to the RC car.</p>

                    <p>This was the project that sparked my interest in electronics, as well indirectly leading me to learn more about programming and the practical applications of basic engineering princibles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Inside this same class, I also learned about the six fundamental machines, as well as created a complex machine out of several of all the six funamental machnes. The goal of this machine was to use a pulley system partnered with several levers, a wheel and axle, and an inclined plane to bring an Oreo to a cup of milk.</p>

                    <p>This was the capstone project of the Advanced Engineering class I took the spring trimester of my senior year of high school. I decided on learning and developing my own code in a project. Since Arduino was the most accessible microcontroller that could be programmed, I started on learning C++ from an online website and from the C++ Primer, 5th Edition. </p> 

                    <p>After around 7 weeks of learning, practicing, and creating several small mini-programs, such as a mock grocery store, a simple calculator, a reflex game that displayed time in milliseconds on an LCD, and several LED circuits, I began the planning and construction of my button game. </p>

                    <p>The game consists of 9 buttons, with it being a speed based game where a button lights up and the player has to press it as fast as possible. The game keeps track of the player's score and time, and at the end of the game, displays the player's score and time on an LCD screen. The brains powering the game inside the box is an Arduino Mega, as well as 3 breadboards that control 3 buttons each, with the breadboards providing power to the LED buttons, as well as a method of communication from the buttons to the Arduino and back. </p>
                    
                    <p>This project taught me a lot about programming, electronics, and problem solving. The full code I ended up writing can be seen <a href="https://github.com/leogarcia-git/arduino-button-game-code/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

                <li><a href="https://i.redd.it/2timiszj3gna1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Dog House</b></a>
                    <!--The dog in this photo is not my dog, but the house is really, really, almost shockingly similar to the one I made. I actually made a really good argument towards my school and they let me use their wood for the house, so I ended up getting free wood which was awesome, since wood would have been the most expensive part.-->
                    <p>After being part of my school's woodworking club for a few years, I decided to create two doghouses during the summer for my two dogs. I used pressure treated wood for the base that contacts the ground and cedar wood for the floor, walls, and roof frame. Creating the frames was simple enought, as it was square and rectangle shaped. I used a table saw and a small hand saw for cutting, and lots of sandpaper to ensure no rough edges on the inside or outside. Afterwards, a small amount of varnish to make the house better looking. I used common nails to put all the frames together, and put little rubber feet on the house to make it grip the floor better. After sealing the house with animal safe caulk, and adding a bed and blankets on the inside, the dogs were very happy.</p>
                   <p>This project taught me a lot about woodworking, planning, and problem solving, as well as allowed me to enjoy the limited time I had left with my dogs, as I would soon head over to college.</p>
